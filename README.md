Installation
------------
This add-on is available as part of the Aussie Add-ons repository. Installation instructions are [here][installation].

Once the repo is installed, install the add-on through the menu via
System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file

Settings
--------

You will need set your subscription type and enter the credentials for your AFL Live Pass subscription. Subscriptions obtained from afl.com.au or the free Telstra offer will need your Telstra ID. You will have this already if you bought from afl.com.au, but for the free Telstra offer you may need to create a Telstra ID and/or link your eligible service to it.
Please visit this [Telstra page][hub] to create a new Telstra ID or link an existing one with your mobile service.
If you have purchased an in-app subscription from Google Play or Apple's App Store you will need to enter in a login token which can be displayed in the app, located at the bottom of the 'AFL Live Pass Subscription' page in the settings once you have logged in.

More detailed instructions and help for the Live Pass are in this [document][livepass]

The live streaming bitrates reflect an average bitrate only, you should ideally have twice the bandwidth available to ensure buffer free viewing.
